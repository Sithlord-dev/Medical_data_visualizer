# Medical data visualizer

In this project, we visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations. We will use the dataset to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.
