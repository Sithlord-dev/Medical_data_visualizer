# Medical data visualizer

In this project, you will visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations. We will use the dataset to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices. See the Notebook file for more info.
